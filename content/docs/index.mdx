# Hello

I am in cybersecurity with a focus that includes red teaming. This page is intentionally minimal—no detailed personal methodology, tooling specifics, or operational tradecraft disclosed. Purpose: provide a clear index of what you can find here.

<Callout title="Use This Hub" variant="info">
  Treat each page as a structured reference: quick scan, link out, no distraction. Content is strictly educational and ethical.
</Callout>
