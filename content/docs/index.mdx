# Hello, I'm Admin12121

I explore, break (safely), harden, and explain. My path into cybersecurity started with a single question: *"How does this actually work under the hood?"* That curiosity turned into late-night packet captures, intentionally misconfigured VMs, and a passion for defending systems while understanding how attackers think.

## Snapshot of Me

- Role Focus: Aspiring Security Engineer / Blue + Purple Team mindset  
- Core Interests: Threat detection, incident response, secure architecture, exploit methodology  
- Style: Hands-on labs first, theory second, teach it third  
- Motto: Learn. Lab. Document. Share. Repeat.  

## Origin Story

I began like many do—experimenting with web apps, learning how simple flaws (like insecure direct object references and poor input validation) can unravel trust. Instead of chasing quick exploits, I became obsessed with *why they were possible* and *how to prevent them at scale*. That led me from basic scripting in Python and Bash to diving into:

- Network fundamentals (OSI layers, segmentation, DNS quirks)
- Cloud security principles (least privilege, identity boundaries)
- Linux internals (processes, permissions, kernel surface)
- Detection engineering (log sources, signal vs noise)
- Secure coding patterns (sanitization, auth flows, dependency hygiene)

## Timeline So Far

| Phase | Focus | Key Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Exploration | Web basics, HTTP, simple vulnerabilities | Learned structured bug analysis |
| Foundation | Linux, networking, scripting | Built reproducible lab environments |
| Adversarial Thinking | Threat modeling, MITRE ATT&CK | Mapped attacker techniques to detections |
| Defense Engineering | Hardening, logging, SIEM tuning | Reduced noise, increased true positives |
| Sharing | Documentation, mentoring | Turned complex topics into approachable narratives |

## Current Lab Stack

I maintain a rotating homelab designed to simulate attacker vs defender scenarios:

- Hypervisor: Proxmox + containerized services
- Network: Segmented VLANs for prod / dev / attack zones
- Attack Box: Kali + custom scripts (enum, log injection testing)
- Detection: Open-source SIEM + Zeek + Suricata for network telemetry
- Defense: Hardened Linux baseline, endpoint sensor trials
- Automation: Python + PowerShell for enrichment and log parsing

## What I'm Building / Improving Right Now

- Writing detection rules focused on behavioral chains (not single events)
- Exploring memory forensics workflows with Volatility
- Practicing cloud IAM abuse paths and their mitigations
- Creating mini write-ups turning messy raw logs into actionable stories
- Converting lab experiments into repeatable runbooks

## Philosophy

Security is not a product—it's an evolving practice. I approach it like a feedback loop:

1. Hypothesize attack path or weakness  
2. Emulate / simulate safely  
3. Observe telemetry quality  
4. Improve controls + visibility  
5. Document for future automation  

The goal isn't perfect defense; it's *resilient detection* and *rapid, confident response*.

## Favorite Analogy

Cybersecurity feels like maintaining a castle where some walls are invisible, some doors are forgotten, and the attackers can shape-shift. My job? Illuminate, simplify, and fortify—without slowing down the kingdom inside.

## Skills At a Glance

- Languages: Python, Bash, PowerShell (utility scripting)  
- Platforms: Linux, Windows, Docker, cloud providers  
- Focus Areas: Hardening, detection engineering, threat modeling, log analysis  
- Tooling: Wireshark, Zeek, Suricata, Volatility, Burp, Nmap, OSQuery  
- Mindset: Adversarial empathy + defensive design

## How I Learn

- Micro-goals over marathon cramming  
- Lab > theory > explanation > refinement  
- Reverse-engineer mistakes to design guardrails  
- Teach concepts early to pressure-test understanding  

## Where I'm Headed

I aim to specialize in building telemetry pipelines, detection content, and secure system baselines—bridging the gap between engineering and security operations. Long term: architecting adaptive defenses that convert diverse log streams into decision-ready intelligence.

## Want to Connect?

If you're building labs, tuning detections, or just curious about getting started, reach out. I love comparing notes and refining ideas with other curious minds.
