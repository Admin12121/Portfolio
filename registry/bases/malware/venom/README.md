# Venom

Controlled Malware Research & Defensive Analysis Framework

## Overview (Short Description)

Venom is an educational, Rust-based remote agent designed for malware development research, detection analysis, and defensive security training within a strictly controlled and authorized environment.

The project demonstrates how modern malware-like tooling can be architected, operated, and detected, enabling both Red Team (offensive simulation) and Blue Team (defensive detection and response) learning.

Venom is not intended for real-world exploitation. Instead, it serves as a hands-on learning platform for understanding contemporary malware behaviors, command-and-control (C2
) techniques, and corresponding detection and mitigation strategies.

## Legal & Ethical Notice

This page is intended for educational, lawful, and ethical investigative purposes only.
Accessing, interacting with, or utilizing available resources from this project for illegal purposes may be unlawful depending on your jurisdiction.

The author is not responsible for any misuse of this tool or the data gathered using it.

Use of this project is restricted to:
- Systems you own, or Systems for which you have explicit, written authorization
- Authorized personnel within a controlled environment for educational and defensive security training purposes.

## Project Purpose & Scope

Venom is intentionally designed to resemble real-world lightweight malware agents, while remaining transparent and auditable for learning purposes. It allows researchers and defenders to:

- Study modern malware design patterns
- Understand command-and-control workflows
- Observe how malware evades naive detection
- Practice endpoint detection, threat hunting, and incident response
- Simulate Red Team vs Blue Team exercises

This repository does not promote illegal access, hacking, or unauthorized surveillance.

## High-Level Architecture

Venom operates as a Discord-based command-and-control (C2) agent, using Discord slash commands as a communication layer. This mimics a modern trend where attackers abuse legitimate cloud platforms to blend in with normal traffic.

### Core components:
- Rust-based agent binary
- Discord bot as C2 interface
- Windows-native screen and camera capture utilities
- Persistent agent identity

| Feature            | Windows | Linux / macOS |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------- |
| Command execution  | ✅       | ✅              |
| Screenshot capture | ✅       | (working on it) |
| Camera capture     | ✅       | (working on it) |

Note: Screen and camera capture rely on Windows APIs (GDI+ and Media Foundation).
